This README documents the sample test for
Develop a small application, preferably in Java that communicates with Github API and does the
following
a) It’s taking input through the command line CLI (1st param = Search string, 2nd param =
release tag)
b) Search Github for repositories that match the given search string “TestNG”
c) Sort the results by the number of stars in a descending order and print the top result name
and stars
d) For the top result repository read the latest release tag and verify if the 2nd param given by
CLI refer to an older or newer release tag (e.g. 6.13.1) and print it in a message
e) Add tests for your project to provide good code coverage

To run
1. Download and Open in Eclipse (or your preferred Java IDE).
2. Install Java and add to the project build path
3. Run GitTest.java as a Java Appliation


Please Note:
I was not able to complete this test fully, my apologies for that. 
I wanted to still submit my effort, albeit falling short of the expected criteria.  
My inexperience with GitHub API's (and Java API's in general) meant I only got as far as (b).
I will however continue to prove out a solution to aid my own learning and development going forward. 

Please contact lisahhenry@gmail.com for any issues.
